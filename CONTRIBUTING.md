## Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style Guide

1. **Use Modern JavaScript (ES6+)**

   ```javascript
   // Good
   const translateText = async (text) => {
     const result = await fetch(url);
     return result.json();
   };

   // Avoid
   var translateText = function (text) {
     return fetch(url).then(function (result) {
       return result.json();
     });
   };
   ```

2. **Consistent Indentation**

   - Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
   - Be consistent throughout the file

3. **Meaningful Variable Names**

   ```javascript
   // Good
   const targetLanguage = "fr";
   const translatedText = await translateText(word);

   // Avoid
   const tl = "fr";
   const t = await translateText(w);
   ```

4. **Comments for Complex Logic**

   ```javascript
   // Create a MutationObserver to detect when YouTube subtitles are loaded
   let observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
     attachListener();
   });
   ```

5. **Error Handling**

   Always use try-catch for async operations:

   ```javascript
   async function translateText(text) {
     try {
       const response = await fetch(url);
       if (!response.ok) {
         throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
       }
       return await response.json();
     } catch (error) {
       console.error("Translation error:", error);
       return "Error translating text";
     }
   }
   ```
